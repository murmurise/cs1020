How to SSH with Mac OSX?

Prerequisites: You must either be on campus and using the NUS/NUSOPEN networks (sign in under your NUSNET account) or you must VPN in to use the sunfire server.
For a guide on how to VPN, see: 
https://docs.comp.nus.edu.sg/node/1553 or 
https://docs.comp.nus.edu.sg/node/2454 (requires SOC login)

Ok, let's get started:
1. Run terminal (search in spotlight for 'Terminal' or select 'Terminal' from the applications>utilities folder)
2. Type <ssh userid@sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg> (Note that this userid is you SOC account and password)
3. Enter your password.
4. You're in!

If you are off campus, there is an alternative in the sunfire-r server. There is no need to vpn for the sunfire-r server.
1. Run terminal (search in spotlight for 'Terminal' or select 'Terminal' from the applications>utilities folder)
2. Type <ssh userid@sunfire-r.comp.nus.edu.sg> (Note that this userid is you SOC account and password)
3. Enter your password.
4. You're in!

If you're prompted about a RSA key, just type yes.


How to transfer files between Mac and sunfire?
1. Use cyberduck

2. Alternatively, you can use the command line to transfer files 
   to and from  sunfire. 

   Use the scp(Security Copy) command from you local Mac terminal. 
   (NOTE: This is to be done without SSHing into sunfire)
   The scp commands works like the cp command.

   The format  is:
            scp <source-path> <destination-path>

   Use  -r flag after scp in case you are transferring an entire directory.

   Example Usage:
   For transferring a directory lab1 in your Downloads 
   directory to your home directory on sunfire,
            scp -r ~/Downloads/lab1 axxxxxx@sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg:~/

   Replace axxxxxxx with your username in sunfire.

   To transfer the file back to your computer, simply invert the source and destiantion

            scp -r axxxxxx@sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg:~/lab1 ~/Downloads/
